    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Nova P. Lynxie, but you can call me 'Nova'.<br>
        I'm quite a very cheerful, carefree, optimistic and at times fairly shy individual.<br>
        Sometimes I do find it difficult to start a conversation when meeting new peeps but once you get to know me I am quite friendly and open to most discussions.<br>
        <br>
        I occasionally work on some small coding projects here and there, with experience in Javascript and some Python. Though am mostly into Javascript, especially NodeJS apps.<br>
        One such project is CoraBot, my own personal Discord.JS bot for my Discord server which runs on NodeJS. It was made when I decided to mess around with code and got interest in Javascript so is mostly a hobby project.<br>
        <br>
        Some programming languages I have used are Python, NodeJS (Javascript runtime) and a bit of ExpressJS.<br>
        Though I have tried using Rust, Lua and some others, I don't really use them as much.<br>
        <br>
        I also have my own personal site which is built using ExpressJS and the Pug templating engine hosted on replit. You can check it out <a href="https://lynxies-website.novalynxie.repl.co/">here</a><br>
